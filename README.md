# Cycling Traffic - Dublin Council Counters

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to investigate cycling traffic patterns in Dublin City. The dataset, provided by the Dublin City Council, contains the number of cyclists counted hourly across different street sensors.

---

## Project Context

This work was developed as part of the **Data Exploration & Preparation** module (Semester 7) of the BSc (Hons) in Computing & IT at **CCT College Dublin**.

---

## Objectives

- Identify high and low traffic areas for cyclists.
- Understand seasonal and daily cycling trends.
- Use clustering (K-Means) and PCA to uncover insights.
- Support planning decisions through data-driven findings.
